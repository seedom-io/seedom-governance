\subsection{Percentage of Ownership}
A member's ownership of the Company is the total of his Voting Shares and Nonvoting Shares, together with all the rights that arise from the ownership of such shares. The Percentage of Ownership ("Ownership Percentage") shall be calculated by adding together that Member's membership shares (Voting and Nonvoting) and then dividing this sum by the total of all the Members' membership shares (Voting and Nonvoting).

\subsection{Membership Classifications}
The Company shall issue Class A Voting Membership Shares ("Voting Shares") to the members who vote (the "Voting Members"). The Voting Members shall have the right to vote on all company matters, as outlined in this Agreement.\\\\
The Company may issue Class B Nonvoting Membership Shares ("Nonvoting Shares"). Nonvoting Shares hold no voting rights whatsoever, and members who only own Nonvoting Shares will have no right to vote on any matters. Members may hold both Voting Shares and Nonvoting Shares.

\subsection{Management by Managers}
The Voting Members shall manage the Company. In their capacity as Managers, they shall have the right to make decisions and vote upon all matters as specified in this Agreement, in proportion to their respective Ownership Percentage of the Company. Voting Members need not identify whether or not they are acting as a Member or a Manager when they take action.\\\\
Nonvoting Members have no right to participate in the management of the Company, nor vote on any matters of the Company. No Nonvoting Member shall take any action or enter into any contract or obligation on behalf of the Company without the prior written consent of all the Voting Members. Likewise, no Nonvoting Member shall perform any act that is in any way pertaining to the Company or its assets.

\subsection{New Members}
The Voting Members may issue additional Voting Capital or Nonvoting Capital and thereby admit a new Member or Members, as the case may be, to the Company, only if such new Member (a) is approved unanimously by the Voting Members; (b) delivers to the Company his required capital contribution; and (c) agrees in writing to be bound by the terms of this Agreement by becoming a party hereto.\\\\
Upon the admission of a new Member to the Company, the capital accounts of all Members, and the calculations that are based on the capital accounts, shall be adjusted appropriately.

No Member shall be personally responsible for any debts, liabilities, or obligations of the Company solely by reason of being a Member. All debts, obligations, and liabilities of the Company, whether by contract or not, shall belong solely to the Company.

\subsection{Transfer and Assignment of Interests}
Membership Shares can be transferred upon the unanimous approval of the other members. However, the assignment of a Membership Shares for the purpose of profit and loss distributions can occur at any time, but the Assignee shall have no right to participate in the management of the business and affairs of the Company.\\\\
If a creditor obtains a lien or a charging order against any Member's membership interest, or in the event of a Member's bankruptcy or other involuntary transfer of interest, this act shall constitute a material breach of this Agreement by such Member. The creditor or claimant shall only be considered an Assignee and will be limited to the rights of such. The creditor or claimant shall have no right to become a Member or have rights to management participation nor have the right to participate as a Member or Manager in any regard to the affairs of the Company. Said creditor or claimant shall only be entitled to receive the share of profit and losses, or the return of capital, to which the Member would otherwise have been entitled.\\\\
The Members may unanimously elect to purchase all or any part of the membership shares that are subject to the charging order, bankruptcy, lien, or other involuntary transfer at a discounted price. The price shall be equal to one-half of the fair market value of such shares. Written notice of such purchase shall be provided to the creditor or claimant.
